## 2026-09-10 — Pre-market Research (OFF-CYCLE local run, ~14:40 ET, market open)

> Run context: executed manually via /pre-market at 14:40 ET, ~80 min before the
> close — not the scheduled 06:00 CT slot. Perplexity unconfigured, so research
> used the native WebSearch fallback (no Perplexity citations). Date taken from
> the Alpaca market clock, NOT the local machine clock, which is 12h fast.

### Account
- Equity: $200.00
- Cash: $200.00 (settled, cash account — multiplier 1)
- Buying power: $200.00
- Daytrade count: not reported (cash account; PDT N/A)
- Positions: none. Open orders: none.

### Market Context
- WTI / Brent: Brent settled $101.21 (+3.4%) on 9/9, highest since July; renewed
  Iran-U.S. attacks near the Strait of Hormuz driving energy supply fear.
- S&P 500: closed 7,636.36 (-37.16, -0.5%) on 9/9. S&P and Nasdaq declining again
  today on the oil move.
- VIX: ~16.3-17.6, up ~7% intraday. Near 10-yr average — no panic, but hedging
  demand is picking up into a seasonally volatile stretch.
- Today's catalysts: PPI released 08:30 ET today. Treasury yields at 52-week highs.
- Economic calendar: **CPI tomorrow (Fri 9/11) 08:30 ET** — the dominant near-term risk.
- Sector momentum: Energy leading (oil shock). Tech slumping. Rate-sensitives
  pressured by the yield move.

### Candidates screened (live Alpaca quotes, $40 whole-share ceiling)
| Ticker | Ask | Spread | Verdict |
|--------|-----|--------|---------|
| HAL  | 36.13 | 0.03% | PASSES — 1 sh = 18.1% of equity |
| KMI  | 31.19 | 0.03% | PASSES — 1 sh = 15.6% of equity |
| RIG  |  5.76 | 0.17% | PASSES — 6 sh = $34.56 (17.3%) |
| CTRA | 34.54 | 11.32% | SKIP — spread far too wide (see feed caveat) |
| OKE  | 99.35 | 3.93% | SKIP — over $40 cap AND wide spread |
| DVN  | 49.81 | 0.02% | SKIP — over the 20% cap ($40) |
| APA  | 44.89 | 0.02% | SKIP — over the 20% cap ($40) |
| SLB  | 56.12 | 0.02% | SKIP — over the 20% cap ($40) |

### Trade Ideas (WATCHLIST ONLY — not actionable today)
1. HAL — oilfield services levered to a sustained crude bid. Entry <= $36.50,
   stop $33.96 (-7%), target $41.58 (+14%), R:R 2:1. Needs oil strength to hold
   through CPI.
2. KMI — midstream, lower beta, steadier than E&P on an oil spike. Entry <= $31.40,
   stop $29.20 (-7%), target $35.80 (+14%), R:R 2:1.
3. RIG — speculative offshore driller, highest beta to crude of the three. Only
   with a smaller size; skip if CPI turns risk-off.

### Risk Factors
- CPI tomorrow 08:30 ET is binary and unhedgeable at this size. A hot print with
  yields already at 52-wk highs is the obvious downside path.
- Oil is 3 days into a geopolitical spike. Buying day 3 of a headline move is
  chasing; Hormuz headlines mean-revert violently on any de-escalation.
- 80 minutes to the close is not enough time for a thesis to work, and a same-day
  buy leaves the stop exposed to an overnight gap that trailing stops do not cover.
- T+1 settlement: all $200 is settled now, but any exit locks proceeds until the
  next business day.

### Decision
**HOLD.** No orders. Three independent reasons: this is an off-cycle run with 80
minutes left in the session, CPI lands tomorrow pre-open, and the leading sector is
mid-spike rather than early. Re-evaluate at the 06:00 CT pre-market run tomorrow
AFTER the CPI print is known. Patience > activity.

## 2026-09-10 — PIVOT: stocks -> crypto
The entry above (HAL/KMI/RIG energy screen) is from the stocks era — historical
only, do not act on it. The account now trades crypto USD pairs exclusively.
Next research run screens crypto pairs against the new gate.

## 2026-09-10 — Crypto Research (local run, 19:39 UTC)

> Perplexity unconfigured -> native WebSearch fallback, no Perplexity citations.
> Date from the Alpaca clock (19:39 UTC); the machine clock is 12h fast.
> First run under the two-sleeve model.

### Account
- Equity: $200.00 | Cash: $200.00 | Deployed: 0%
- Positions: none. Open orders: none. Stop coverage: N/A.
- Capacity: CORE 3 slots ($120), TACTICAL 3 slots ($80). Trades used: 0/3 wk, 0/3 day.

### Market Context
- BTC $77,155 (screen) / ~$78,039 earlier, -1% on 24h. ETH $2,464, -0.7%.
- Global market cap -0.9% to $2.76T. Both majors opened at week lows.
- **FOMC starts Tuesday with a 62.2% implied chance of a RATE HIKE.** Higher
  rates are directly negative for crypto.
- **CPI tomorrow (2026-09-11) 08:30 ET**, after today's PPI. Last inflation
  reads before the Fed decides.
- Macro backdrop from the equity session: Brent >$100 on Iran/Hormuz, Treasury
  yields at 52-week highs. Risk-off, not risk-on.

### Universe screen (all 33 pairs — scripts/screen.sh)
CORE shortlist, daily bars (5): DOT XTZ SUSHI GRT UNI
TACTICAL shortlist, hourly bars (19): SKY UNI POL ETH RENDER LDO TRUMP SOL AAVE
CRV SHIB DOT GRT YFI ADA ARB FIL DOGE LINK

Read the tactical list carefully: the hourly 30-period momentum is NEGATIVE for
every single one of the 33 coins (-0.4% to -11.9%). All 19 "passes" are a ~7-hour
bounce inside a 30-hour downtrend, driven by one macro move. They are not 19
independent setups — they are one correlated setup wearing 19 tickers. Taking 3
tactical positions here would be three bets on the same bounce.

### Candidate notes
- DOT — the only strong catalyst in the universe: OpenGov Referendum 1944 for a
  native stablecoin (dotUSD) at ~97.5% in favour, a 150% transaction spike and
  record XCM throughput on 9/7, plus a short-liquidation squeeze. But +24% on
  the week and +18.1% over SMA20 — it barely clears the <=20% extension filter,
  and a squeeze-driven leg is exactly the kind that retraces.
- XTZ — Tezos X mainnet targeted for summer 2026, named an altseason contender
  on 8/23. Real but vague; no dated near-term catalyst.
- SUSHI / GRT / UNI — pass on trend mechanics with no specific catalyst found.
  Gate requires a documented catalyst, so none are entry-eligible today.

### Risk Factors
- A 62% probability of a rate hike is the single most important fact here, and
  it lands 2 trading days out. CORE holds are weeks-long by design; opening one
  into that is choosing the worst entry window available.
- CPI tomorrow pre-open. A tactical 6% stop is well inside a normal CPI-day
  range for alts, so a stop-out is likelier than a 12% target being reached.
- Everything is correlated to the same macro driver, so position count would
  overstate diversification.
- Fees: 3 tactical round trips cost ~1.05%/wk of the account. Paying that to
  express one macro guess is poor value.

### Decision
**HOLD both sleeves. No orders.**
- CORE: HOLD. Only DOT has a real catalyst and it is extended after a squeeze,
  two days before a probable hike. Waiting costs nothing; the dotUSD narrative
  is not a one-day event.
- TACTICAL: HOLD. 19 nominal passes are one correlated bounce, and CPI tomorrow
  makes a 6% stop a coin flip.

### Triggers for the next run (2026-09-11, post-CPI)
1. CPI printing at or below expectations AND hike odds falling below ~50%
   -> re-screen; DOT becomes CORE-eligible if it has cooled to <=12% over SMA20.
2. CPI hot / hike odds rising -> stay flat. Do not "buy the dip" into a hiking
   Fed; that is not a catalyst, it is hope.
3. Tactical entries only once hourly 30-period momentum turns positive for the
   candidate, so the bounce is confirmed rather than assumed.

### 2026-09-10 20:20 UTC — Intraday addendum (execute run, tactical origination attempted)

First run with tactical origination authority. Outcome: **NO TRADE**, blocked by
the gate — and the blocking rule exposed a defect in the strategy itself.

State: flat, equity $199.92, fee budget $0.00/$3.00 used, breaker clear,
0 of 3 tactical slots filled. Nothing structural prevented a trade.

Tactical shortlist (12): UNI SKY POL DOT ETH TRUMP RENDER AAVE SHIB SOL DOGE YFI
Best candidate: DOT — on the shortlist, spread 0.21%, and the only coin in the
universe with a specific documented catalyst (OpenGov Referendum 1944 for a
native dotUSD stablecoin at ~97.5% in favour, 150% transaction spike, record XCM
throughput).

It failed on R:R after fees:
- notional $20.00, round-trip fee at measured 0.65% = $0.13
- risk if the 6% stop fills: $1.20 + $0.13 = $1.33
- reward if the 12% target fills: $2.40 - $0.13 = $2.27
- R:R = **1.71 : 1**, against a required 2:1 -> FAIL

**DEFECT: the tactical sleeve's own parameters cannot satisfy the gate's own R:R
rule.** A 6% stop with a 12% target is 2:1 gross, but fees are charged on both
legs, so after friction it is 1.71:1. This is not specific to DOT — EVERY
tactical trade fails this check by construction, at any notional, because the
ratio is set by the parameters and not by the candidate. The tactical sleeve as
specified could never have placed a single trade.

To satisfy 2:1 after fees, one of:
- target 14.0% instead of 12% (keeps the 6% stop, needs a bigger move), or
- stop 5.0% instead of 6% (keeps the 12% target, tighter and more whipsaw-prone)

Not self-amending this: the weekly review is the amendment path and it requires
3+ closed trades as evidence, of which there are zero. Flagged for human decision.

Note also that the fee budget worked as intended in the opposite direction: it
was NOT the binding constraint. $0.13 of a $3.00 weekly budget is trivially
affordable — the trade was refused on edge quality, not on cost, which is the
correct order of priority.

## 2026-09-11 — Crypto Research (UTC 15:13)

**Account:** Equity $198.95 | Cash $179.92 | Deployed 9.6% (target 75-85%)
Positions: DOT (TACTICAL) -4.59%, age 18.9h, [SPLIT ok] 0% unreserved.
Fee budget $0.13 / $2.98 used. Breaker clear. Amendment trigger 0/10 — not eligible.

**Market context (WebSearch; PERPLEXITY_API_KEY not set — fallback used, noted per prompt):**
- BTC $78,605 (Alpaca) — down ~1.6% 24h; global mcap $2.7T, -1.9% 24h
- BTC dominance 56.8%, ETH 11% — capital rotating INTO the majors, not out the risk curve
- August PPI +0.4% m/m, +5.4% y/y — hotter than expected, cooled rate-cut hopes
- BTC spot ETFs -$282.56M, worst outflow since July
- **CPI prints TODAY (Sep 11); FOMC decision Sep 16** — the two binding near-term events
- ETH spot ETFs diverging the other way: ~+$863M net YTD vs ~-$1B for BTC; ETH has
  out-gathered BTC two consecutive months; Sep 4 BlackRock ETHA +23.06K ETH

**Narratives:** Majors leading (ETH specifically, on flows). L1/L2 rolling over — DOT,
ADA, XTZ, AVAX all failing one or both screens. Memes mixed and macro-fragile.

**CORE shortlist (15):** DOT SUSHI XTZ ARB GRT FIL ETH LTC AVAX BAT UNI LINK SOL CRV LDO
**TACTICAL shortlist (23):** ETH UNI AAVE PEPE FIL LINK HYPE SOL ARB WIF XRP TRUMP ONDO DOGE SUSHI YFI RENDER LDO POL BTC ADA CRV GRT

ETH is the only pair passing BOTH screens with a top-tier spread:
  CORE 1D: 7d +6.1%, 30d +38.9%, +5.5% vs rising SMA20 (limit 20% — not extended), spr 0.03%
  TACTICAL 1H: 7d +5.3%, +5.0% vs SMA20, vol 1.4% (in 0.4-6% band), spr 0.03%

### Ideas by sleeve

**CORE — ETH/USD — TRADE**
- Catalyst: ETF flow divergence is specific, measurable and sustained — ETH spot ETFs
  ~+$863M net YTD against ~-$1B for BTC, two straight months of out-gathering BTC,
  BlackRock ETHA +23.06K ETH on Sep 4. Glamsterdam upgrade proposals ahead.
- Entry ~$2,609 | Size $40 (20% of equity) | Stop trigger $2,087.60 / limit $1,983.22
- Target: none — CORE lets it run; the ratcheted 20% trail decides the exit
- Risk in dollars: $8.00 at the 20% trail; hard cut -15% = $6.00. Sane at this size.
- Est. round-trip fee $0.26 (0.65% of $40); spread 0.027% is the cheapest in the universe

**TACTICAL — HOLD, no new entries**
- CPI lands today and FOMC is Sep 16. A tactical position has an hours-to-2-day
  horizon, which puts the whole thesis on a macro print rather than on the setup.
  That is a coinflip, not an edge, and it is exactly the churn the fee budget exists
  to stop. The screen passing is not by itself a reason.
- What would change it: CPI printing and the tape holding, with a coin on the hourly
  shortlist carrying its own catalyst rather than borrowing the market's.
- DOT held, not added to: catalyst (dotUSD referendum, XCM throughput highs) is still
  intact so the thesis is not broken, but momentum has rolled over and it now FAILS
  the hourly screen (-5.9% 7d, -4.5% vs SMA20). Age 18.9h is inside the 48h reassess
  window and the -6% stop is resting. Let the stop do its job; no averaging down.

**Risk factors:** CPI today + FOMC Sep 16 either could break the tape. Hot PPI already
landed. BTC ETF outflows show majors bid is not uniform. ETH entered into a risk-off
session — sized and stopped accordingly, and the CORE horizon is weeks-to-months, so a
single print is noise against a 20% trail.

**Decision:** CORE **TRADE** (ETH $40). TACTICAL **HOLD**.
**Fee budget after this trade:** $0.39 / $2.98 used this week.
