## 2026-09-10 — Pre-market Research (OFF-CYCLE local run, ~14:40 ET, market open)

> Run context: executed manually via /pre-market at 14:40 ET, ~80 min before the
> close — not the scheduled 06:00 CT slot. Perplexity unconfigured, so research
> used the native WebSearch fallback (no Perplexity citations). Date taken from
> the Alpaca market clock, NOT the local machine clock, which is 12h fast.

### Account
- Equity: $200.00
- Cash: $200.00 (settled, cash account — multiplier 1)
- Buying power: $200.00
- Daytrade count: not reported (cash account; PDT N/A)
- Positions: none. Open orders: none.

### Market Context
- WTI / Brent: Brent settled $101.21 (+3.4%) on 9/9, highest since July; renewed
  Iran-U.S. attacks near the Strait of Hormuz driving energy supply fear.
- S&P 500: closed 7,636.36 (-37.16, -0.5%) on 9/9. S&P and Nasdaq declining again
  today on the oil move.
- VIX: ~16.3-17.6, up ~7% intraday. Near 10-yr average — no panic, but hedging
  demand is picking up into a seasonally volatile stretch.
- Today's catalysts: PPI released 08:30 ET today. Treasury yields at 52-week highs.
- Economic calendar: **CPI tomorrow (Fri 9/11) 08:30 ET** — the dominant near-term risk.
- Sector momentum: Energy leading (oil shock). Tech slumping. Rate-sensitives
  pressured by the yield move.

### Candidates screened (live Alpaca quotes, $40 whole-share ceiling)
| Ticker | Ask | Spread | Verdict |
|--------|-----|--------|---------|
| HAL  | 36.13 | 0.03% | PASSES — 1 sh = 18.1% of equity |
| KMI  | 31.19 | 0.03% | PASSES — 1 sh = 15.6% of equity |
| RIG  |  5.76 | 0.17% | PASSES — 6 sh = $34.56 (17.3%) |
| CTRA | 34.54 | 11.32% | SKIP — spread far too wide (see feed caveat) |
| OKE  | 99.35 | 3.93% | SKIP — over $40 cap AND wide spread |
| DVN  | 49.81 | 0.02% | SKIP — over the 20% cap ($40) |
| APA  | 44.89 | 0.02% | SKIP — over the 20% cap ($40) |
| SLB  | 56.12 | 0.02% | SKIP — over the 20% cap ($40) |

### Trade Ideas (WATCHLIST ONLY — not actionable today)
1. HAL — oilfield services levered to a sustained crude bid. Entry <= $36.50,
   stop $33.96 (-7%), target $41.58 (+14%), R:R 2:1. Needs oil strength to hold
   through CPI.
2. KMI — midstream, lower beta, steadier than E&P on an oil spike. Entry <= $31.40,
   stop $29.20 (-7%), target $35.80 (+14%), R:R 2:1.
3. RIG — speculative offshore driller, highest beta to crude of the three. Only
   with a smaller size; skip if CPI turns risk-off.

### Risk Factors
- CPI tomorrow 08:30 ET is binary and unhedgeable at this size. A hot print with
  yields already at 52-wk highs is the obvious downside path.
- Oil is 3 days into a geopolitical spike. Buying day 3 of a headline move is
  chasing; Hormuz headlines mean-revert violently on any de-escalation.
- 80 minutes to the close is not enough time for a thesis to work, and a same-day
  buy leaves the stop exposed to an overnight gap that trailing stops do not cover.
- T+1 settlement: all $200 is settled now, but any exit locks proceeds until the
  next business day.

### Decision
**HOLD.** No orders. Three independent reasons: this is an off-cycle run with 80
minutes left in the session, CPI lands tomorrow pre-open, and the leading sector is
mid-spike rather than early. Re-evaluate at the 06:00 CT pre-market run tomorrow
AFTER the CPI print is known. Patience > activity.
